## Notification Profiles
Save and load profiles for Application notifications (Settings -> Notifications)

## Known Issues
1. When loading a profile, all options in Settings -> Notifications seem to be correct but they sometimes reset after a respring.

## To Do
1. Figure out why the loaded profile sometimes resets after a respring.
2. Move the profile selector into the stock iOS location of Settings -> Notifications. I'd like to do this but I don't currently know how. I'll have to look into it and figure it out.
2. Maybe - Add a way to switch to a specific profile using Activator.
3. Maybe - Add a way to switch to a specific profile based on a schedule.
